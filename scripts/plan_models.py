# scripts/plan_models.py
"""The plan, its trace and its id ledger: project-plan/v1, plan-trace/v1, id-ledger/v1.

PORTED FROM otsafety-gnn, where these rules held across a plan of two hundred
steps. Three contracts there; one module here, beside nix_models.py and
command_outcome.py, because this repository keeps its models as flat modules.

INTENT ONLY, NEVER STATUS. A step declares the evidence that proves it done --
a merged pull request, a release tag, a file, a task, a named test -- and status
is observed from that evidence. extra is forbidden, so a hand-written status is
refused rather than trusted: every status written by hand drifts from the work.

SEMANTIC RULES A SCHEMA CANNOT STATE: ids unique across steps and decisions,
every reference resolvable, dependencies acyclic, and a reason only for a
dependency the step actually has. A decision not to do something is data too.

TWO ADAPTATIONS, AND ONE THING NOT PORTED:

  release tags   the source required v1.2.3; this repository's release task
                 tags assignment-NN-vN, so a coursework release could never
                 have been proven done under the source's pattern.
  one module     rather than three, to match how models live here.
  NO LOOPS       the source requires every step to name one of its five
                 loops, which is that project's own architecture vocabulary.
                 Requiring it here would mean inventing a loop for each
                 existing step -- authoring a judgement the history never
                 made. Its absence is recorded as a decision in the plan.
