"""Decide each step's status by policy, from facts observed on the integration branch.

THE PAIR. This module observes: what holds on the ref, as plan-facts/v1.
policies/plan decides each step's state. plan-status/v1 validates the decision
on its way back, because OPA's output crosses a boundary like any other.

OBSERVED ON THE REF, NEVER THE DISK. An uncommitted file must not make a step
look done, so paths, tasks and test functions are read from the ref itself.

A PROOF IS A DEFINED TEST. The source this is ported from checked only that the
test FILE was in the tree, though its own comment promised the named function;
a renamed test went on reading as proof. Here the function must be defined.

UNOBSERVED IS NOT ABSENT. Merged pull requests come from GitHub, which tests and
offline gates cannot reach; unless a reader is passed in, that kind is recorded
as blind, and the policy leaves such a step unknown rather than undone.
