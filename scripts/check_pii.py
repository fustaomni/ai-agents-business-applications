"""Scan tracked files for personal information, by content.

WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE STRUCTURAL CHECKS
.gitignore filters by FORMAT; tests/test_no_data_in_repo.py filters by PATH.
Both are proxies for the real rule, which is about CONTENT. The gap is not
hypothetical: an HTML export of an executed notebook carries names, birth dates
and salaries in its cell outputs.

WHY PERSON IS NOT DETECTED, WHICH LOOKS LIKE A GAP AND IS NOT
The first version enabled PERSON and reported 75 findings, of which roughly 70
were `ruff`, `Darwin`, `ci.yml`, `dict[str`, `.replace` and `cli#4872`. PERSON is
NER-based, and a model trained on prose reads every capitalised identifier in
source code as a name. That is a category error, not a threshold to tune, and
Presidio's own FAQ prescribes the fix: remove recognizers the data does not
need.

The pattern-based recognizers below combine regex with dictionary matching and
give explainable detection with minimal false positives. They found every real
issue in this repo; PERSON found none that they missed.

The same failure is documented elsewhere in different clothes -- general NER
tagging a drug name as a PERSON in clinical text -- and the accepted fix is to
suppress the NER layer rather than allowlist each false positive.

THERE IS NO ALLOWLIST, DELIBERATELY
An earlier draft carried an ALLOWED_TEXT set naming public figures who appear in
assignment questions. That is the "pragma: allowlist" pattern: suppressing a
finding instead of removing its cause, which makes a scanner decoration. Every
finding this reports is now eliminated at source. The first real one -- a
hardcoded email in databricks.yml -- became ${workspace.current_user.userName},
which was better configuration anyway.

WHAT IT STILL CANNOT DO
Free-text names in a committed data file would pass. The structural checks are
what prevent such a file from being tracked at all; this is the layer that
catches a credential-shaped or contact-shaped value hiding in something that
looks like code.
