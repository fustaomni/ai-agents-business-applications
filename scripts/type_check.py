"""type-check/v1: what mypy is configured to check, and every place it is invoked.

THE FILE SET WAS WRITTEN TWICE -- `scripts` in the types task, `scripts tests`
in the gate -- so the task reported success over errors the gate refused. It is
declared once now, in pyproject.toml, and this records every mypy invocation so
the policy can refuse any that names paths: a path on the command line overrides
the configured files, leaving the declaration looking like a control while
governing nothing.

THE COMMANDS COME FROM invocations.py, filtered here to mypy, so the shape of an
invocation is defined once for every policy that reads one.
