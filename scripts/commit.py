# scripts/commit.py
"""Committing, as a task that decides before it acts.

WHAT THIS FIXES. Every commit in this repository was made by hand as
`git commit --file /tmp/commit-msg.txt --no-verify`. Two defects in one habit:

    NOT A TASK      mise.toml states that every project operation is a task,
                    "not a remembered command, not a paste from scrollback".
                    The most frequent operation here was the exception.

    --no-verify     the pre-commit hooks -- start:check, fmt, lint -- were
                    skipped on EVERY commit. The gate was only reached at push
                    time, so a protected-branch commit or an unformatted file
                    was caught late or not at all.

THIS MODULE PLANS; IT DOES NOT YET ACT.

plan_commit answers one question -- may this commit proceed, and with what --
and returns the answer as a command-outcome/v1 envelope. Running git is a
separate concern with its own tests, written next. Splitting them keeps the
decision pure and testable without a repository, and means a caller can show
what WOULD happen before anything is staged.

NAMED PATHS, NEVER -A. `git add -A` swept a stray zero-byte file into a commit
earlier in this project; scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py exists because of it.
Naming the paths makes the content of a commit a decision rather than whatever
the working tree happened to hold.

THE ORDER OF REFUSALS IS DELIBERATE. The branch is checked first because it is
the cheapest and most fundamental guard. The subject is checked BEFORE the
paths, so a rejected message never leaves a half-staged index behind.
