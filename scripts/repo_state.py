# scripts/repo_state.py
"""The repository's branch and worktree state, as a validated snapshot.

WHY A STATE MODEL AND NOT A PIPELINE
`mise run sync` deleted merged branches by piping `git for-each-ref` through
awk. It worked until a worktree held one of those branches, at which point git
refused -- correctly -- and the task aborted mid-way, leaving the sync half done
after the pull had already succeeded.

The bug was not the missing filter. It was that cleanup had no model of what it
was cleaning: it knew "upstream is gone" and nothing else, so every other fact
about a branch was invisible. The documented failure signal for exactly this
class is "reporting cleanup done while a worktree or branch remains".

WHAT THE MODEL MAKES EXPLICIT
  is_protected     develop and main are never deleted, whatever their state
  worktree         the linked worktree holding it, if any -- one branch, one
                   worktree, and git enforces that
  position         where it stands against its remote: in_sync, behind, ahead,
                   diverged, gone (the remote branch was deleted, usually by a
                   merge) or untracked
  is_merged        its commits are in develop

Deletability is then a property of the state rather than a guess, and the reason
a branch is NOT deletable is answerable instead of inferred from an error.

POSITION, NOT A FLAG (D.10). The model kept only whether git's tracking said
[gone] and threw away [behind 21] -- so nothing could see that local main sat
eleven releases behind. upstream_gone is now derived from position, so the two
cannot disagree.

WHY --porcelain -z EVERYWHERE
Human-readable git output is explicitly not a stable interface, and porcelain
does not quote paths -- so a path containing a newline corrupts a line-based
parser. The docs recommend combining --porcelain with -z for that reason.
