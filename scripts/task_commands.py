"""The commands each task runs, as typed data: task-input/v1 and Command.

ONE PARSER, SHARED. It lived inside evaluate_policies.py; the type-check
observer needs it too, and importing it from there would have made a cycle once
the pipeline imported the observer. Moved, not copied.

THROUGH A MODEL. mise.toml was read with raw tomllib and handed on as a dict,
and each command as a dict a caller had to pick apart with isinstance. The file
is validated as it enters, and a command is a Command.

A NEWLINE ENDS A COMMAND. The parser split on | && || ; & and treated a newline
as whitespace, so a two-line body read as ONE command. Backslash-continued lines
are joined first, so a command spanning lines stays one, and a quoted string
spanning lines stays one token.
