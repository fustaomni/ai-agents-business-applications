# scripts/command_outcome.py
"""What a command says when it finishes, as data.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every command here prints prose, so a caller reads it with
grep: presentation filtering, not evidence. check_all.py prints PASS and FAIL,
pr.py prints sentences, and nix_contract.py prints JSON of its own invented
shape. None of it is a declared contract, so nothing downstream can depend on
it without breaking when the wording changes.

2026 practice for a command an agent may run is stream separation -- stdout
carries the payload and nothing else, stderr carries progress and diagnostics --
with a contract field naming the schema, a stable machine code rather than
prose, and deterministic exit codes.

THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO, AND THAT IS THE POINT.

A refusal is not a failure: the command worked and denied what was asked. This
repository already draws that line INSIDE the Nix contract -- POLICY_DENIED is
not an error, and absence is an observation rather than an exception -- and then
loses it at the process boundary, where exit 1 means both "the policy said no"
and "the command broke".

    success   0   it did what was asked
    failed    1   the command itself broke
    refused   2   the request or the repository state was not allowed

A caller branches on the exit code without reading a word, and a CI step can
treat a refusal differently from a crash.

WHY THE CODE IS SNAKE_CASE WHILE POLICY CODES ARE NOT.

policies/ emits ERR_TASK_MISE_EXEC and WARN_NIX_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM: a RULE's
identity, read from its annotation by `opa inspect -a`. This code is a
COMMAND's: what the command did, not what a rule found. Two namespaces, kept
visibly distinct so a reader never has to ask which kind of code they are
holding. A command that reports a policy denial carries the rule's codes in
`data`, where they stay the policy's own.
