"""Validate that this process satisfies the declared runtime contract.

WHY THIS EXISTS WHEN A POLICY ALREADY DOES
policies/runtime/ denies a TASK that names a bare interpreter. It cannot see a
script invoked any other way -- by an editor, a CI step, a shell alias, a
person. Static policy governs what the repo declares; this governs what is
actually executing.

The gap was not hypothetical. Fourteen tasks ran on Homebrew's Python 3.14.7
rather than the pinned 3.12.3, outside the venv, for as long as they existed.
They passed because they used only the standard library, and check:env-parity
never noticed: it compares two DECLARATIONS and never asks which interpreter is
running.

WHY sys.prefix AND NOT VIRTUAL_ENV
The venv documentation names `sys.prefix != sys.base_prefix` as the reliable
detection. VIRTUAL_ENV is an environment variable -- easy to lose, easy to fake,
and absent whenever an interpreter is invoked directly rather than through an
activation script. A process can be inside a venv with VIRTUAL_ENV unset.
Interpreter state is evidence; the shell environment is a claim.

BEING IN A VENV IS NOT ENOUGH
Another project's venv satisfies prefix != base_prefix and contains none of this
project's locked dependencies, so the check is against THIS venv specifically.

WHY enforce() IS CALLED, NOT RUN AT IMPORT
Import-time enforcement is the obvious design and is wrong three times over.
It makes the failure path untestable, since importing the module inside a test
would end the run. It is the named anti-pattern of doing work during
construction -- "you cannot even construct the object without triggering
external work" -- and this reads a file. And PEP 810 lazy imports, landing in
Python 3.15, shift side effects from import time to first use, so anything
depending on import-time execution becomes unreliable.

A check that cannot be tested for its failure path is a check this session has
repeatedly shown to be worth nothing.
