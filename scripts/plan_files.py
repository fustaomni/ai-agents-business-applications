"""Read the plan, its trace and its id ledger, and name every way they disagree.

    plan.toml  x  plan-trace.toml  x  plan-ids.toml  ->  agreement, or the gaps

A MATRIX NOBODY VERIFIES IS AN ARCHIVE. Four disagreements are named: an item
no source authorises, a claim about an item the plan no longer holds, an id the
ledger never issued, and a retired id back in use.

TOML, READ BY THE STANDARD LIBRARY. These files are written and annotated by a
person, and TOML coerces nothing implicitly; YAML would have added a parser this
repository never needed, whose usual default reads `no` as false.
