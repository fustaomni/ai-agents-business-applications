# scripts/export_copy.py
"""Copy a released assignment's HTML export out of the repository, verified (D.21).

THE PAIR. export-copy/v1 records the assignment, its newest release tag, the source
and destination and both digests; export.copy refuses an unreleased assignment, a
missing export, an existing destination and a copy that differs from its source.
The policy is asked before anything is written, and again after the copy.

NEVER OVERWRITES. The copy is opened in exclusive-create mode, so even a file that
appears between the check and the write is left alone. Named for its tag -- for
example assignment_02_etl_assignment-02-v1.html -- so a released file cannot be
mistaken for a draft. Run through `mise run run`, which records it.
