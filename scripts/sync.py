# scripts/sync.py
"""Return to develop, bring every long-lived branch current, and remove only what is safe.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A SHELL PIPELINE
The previous implementation deleted every branch whose upstream reported [gone].
When a worktree held one, git refused and the task aborted mid-sync. The fix is
not a filter -- it is having a model of the state, so "may this be deleted" is
answered by the state rather than discovered from an error.

EVERY LONG-LIVED BRANCH, NOT ONLY THE ONE CHECKED OUT (D.10). sync pulled the
branch it stood on and nothing else, so local main sat eleven releases behind.
A branch nobody has checked out is updated with `git fetch origin main:main`,
which git refuses unless it is a fast-forward -- a divergence surfaces instead
of being clobbered. git also refuses to fetch into a branch a worktree holds, so
that one is fast-forwarded inside its own worktree, and only when it is clean.
Ahead and diverged need a person: they are reported, never forced.

THEN THE INVARIANT IS ASKED, NOT ASSUMED. machine.branches judges the state
after the updates, and anything still out of place fails sync loudly.
