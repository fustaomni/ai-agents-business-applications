"""Evaluate the repo's own tasks and bundle against the Rego policies.

THE SPLIT THAT MATTERS, BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFERENCE IN KIND
  check:policy   are the policies well-formed and tested?
  this script    does the CODEBASE satisfy them?

A policy suite can be immaculate and enforce nothing. `opa test` proves the rules
behave; only evaluating real input proves the repo obeys them.

ENTRYPOINTS ARE DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED
They were a hand-maintained tuple, and policies/merge was written, tested and
committed without being added to it -- so its rules passed their unit tests and
were never evaluated against this repo at all. The gate went green for a policy
enforcing nothing.

That is the same shape as the known-first-party list that went stale three times:
a second copy of something the directory already knows. Package names now come
from the .rego files themselves, so a new policy is enforced because it exists.
