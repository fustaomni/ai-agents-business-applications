# scripts/named_tasks.py
"""Every task a message tells the reader to run is a task mise.toml declares (D.56).

A remediation message is an instruction. check_prereqs.py and databricks.yml told the
reader to run bootstrap:groups long after bootstrap:identity replaced it,
so the advice failed at the moment someone followed it.

TWO SOURCES, NO NEW PARSER: tracked lines come from source:search (D.27), and the
declared tasks from tasks:list (D.35) -- mise's own resolution, hidden tasks included.
Rego decides (policies/tasks/named); this module only observes.

A TOKEN NAMES A TASK ONLY WHEN IT IS A WHOLE TASK NAME: `plan:{verb}` is a template and
`<slug>` a placeholder, and reading `plan:` out of the first would refuse a correct message.

NOT INSTRUCTIONS: tests/ holds synthetic mentions, and context/ holds sources verbatim.

UNTRACKED FILES COUNT: the guard judges what is about to be committed. Tracked-only, it
passed check while this very module was new, and pre-push refused it once committed.
