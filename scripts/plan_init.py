# scripts/plan_init.py
"""A project starts its own plan by task (D.53).

A project generated from the platform template carries no plan: it would otherwise
inherit the source's history as its own. plan:init writes a day-one plan, its trace
and its id ledger -- one thread, one step, one source -- validated together through
project-plan/v1, id-ledger/v1 and plan-trace/v1 before any is written, as plan:add
writes. It refuses when any plan file exists: a plan is extended, never reset.

THE SHAPES plan:add EXPECTS: steps an array of tables, issued and candidates inline
arrays, so plan:add and plan:amend work on the new project from its first commit.
