"""Remediation as data an agent can act on -- and a classification of what it may act on.

WHY THIS EXISTS
ContractProblem.remediation was PROSE. An agent wanting to fix a problem had to
parse an English sentence, which is the string-matching fragility this
repository removes everywhere else. Machine-readable codes without
machine-readable actions is half a design.

WHY THE CONTRACT STILL DOES NOT EXECUTE ANY OF IT
The obvious next step -- have the agent run the installer and re-observe -- is
the one the 2026 guidance gates specifically. The boundary is stated the same
way across sources: "investigation can and should be autonomous; execution of a
destructive change should be gated", and the mental model is "automated
investigation, human-approved remediation", not self-healing. OWASP puts it as
"separate decision-making from execution for irreversible operations".

Auto-action is defensible only inside "narrow scope, reversible actions, and a
signed audit trail". Installing Nix creates an encrypted APFS volume, a launchd
daemon, 32 system users, and edits /etc/fstab, /etc/zshrc and /etc/bashrc. It is
neither narrow nor reversible in place.

THE LADDER, AND WHERE EACH PROBLEM SITS
The established model is three rungs -- alert, approve, auto-act -- where "rules
earn their way up as confidence grows" and "a defensible policy keeps the
reversible, low-risk classes automatable and gates the rest".

Every problem this contract can detect requires a privileged, system-wide
change. So nothing here is AUTO. That is a finding rather than a limitation: a
tier no problem currently occupies is honest, and it keeps the classification
meaningful if a reversible problem is added later.

    WHY EXCEPTIONS NEEDED THIS TOO
    ContractProblem has carried code + message + remediation for a while, but
    EXCEPTIONS were bare strings -- so every failure path got hand-written prose,
    and the same "diagnostic discarded" defect was fixed four separate times in
    four modules. Writing a better string each time is the treadmill; giving
    errors a shape is the fix.

    The structure is the documented one: "state the problem, guide the user on
    fixing it". And for this codebase specifically it matters twice over, because
    a CLI now "serves humans and AI agents from one binary" -- and "agents need
    remediation DECLARED, not inferred".

    tests/test_nix_errors.py enumerates every subclass and fails if one omits a
    code or a remediation, which is the "automated coverage that prevents new
    errors from going unclassified".
