"""environment-versions/v1: the Databricks environment version to interpreter mapping.

ONE SHAPE, READ IN TWO PLACES. check_env_parity.py and its tests both parsed
contracts/environment-versions.json raw, and the tests re-asserted its shape by
hand -- every version has a python, keys are numeric, the source is documented.
Those assertions WERE the schema, written as asserts. They live here now, and
the gate and its tests read the same model, so the two cannot drift.

THE FILE IS HAND-MAINTAINED, transcribed from Databricks' documentation, which
exposes environment versions as a reference table rather than an API. Its
source and review trigger are therefore required fields: the seam stays visible.
