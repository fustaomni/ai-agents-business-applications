"""hooks/v1: what the git hooks run, read as lefthook reads its own configuration.

LEFTHOOK RE-SYNCS HOOKS ITSELF while auto-install is on, which is how a new
commit-msg hook reached every checkout without anyone re-running setup. This
records whether that stays enabled and what each hook runs, so the policy can
refuse a configuration that would let hooks silently stop arriving -- or that
drops the commit-msg job running plan:trailers.

THROUGH `lefthook dump`, NOT A YAML PARSE OF OUR OWN: lefthook merges local
overrides and remotes, and omits defaults, so its view is the one that runs.
