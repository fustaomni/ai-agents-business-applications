# scripts/env_sync.py
"""Sync brings the environment to a lock that changed (D.38).

GROUNDED. After pulling changes that touched uv.lock, run uv sync. 2026 practice
asks git which files changed between the old and new commits and syncs only when
the lockfile is among them; --locked fails loudly if the lock disagrees with
pyproject.toml instead of silently re-resolving.

THE PAIR. environment-sync/v1 records whether the lock changed, whether the
environment was brought to it and the install's exit code; machine.environment
refuses a stale environment, so sync fails rather than leave .venv behind its lock.
