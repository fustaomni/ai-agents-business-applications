"""An append-only, hash-chained record of contract runs.

WHAT THIS IS
Each run appends one JSON line carrying the hash of the previous line. Editing,
reordering or deleting a record mid-file breaks the chain at that point and at
every point after it, so alteration is DETECTABLE by recomputing.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, STATED PLAINLY BECAUSE THE DISTINCTION IS USUALLY ELIDED
Tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-PROOF. A local file is inherently mutable. The chain
detects in-place edits, reorders and mid-chain deletions. It does NOT detect:

  TAIL TRUNCATION   deleting the last N records leaves a shorter valid chain
  GENESIS REWRITE   discarding the file and starting again verifies cleanly

Both are closed the same way and neither is done here: anchoring the chain head
somewhere the writer cannot reach -- an off-machine log, a transparency log, a
timestamp authority. "A hash chain on a single machine is better than no chain,
but it still has a single point of failure."

AND IT IS NOT SOC 2 EVIDENCE
Saying so would be false. A compliance auditor asks how you know the logs were
not modified, and "the chain verifies" answers that only for records still
present, written by a process the same user controls. This is a local integrity
aid for a developer machine. Calling it compliance would be the kind of claim
this repository exists to avoid making.

WHO RAN IT: AN OPAQUE ID, NOT A USERNAME
OWASP asks for the actor. A username or hostname is identifying data -- this
machine's hostname contains a person's name -- and the repository runs a PII
scanner to keep exactly that out of artifacts. A random identifier generated
once and stored locally distinguishes machines without naming anyone.

    THE UNLOCKED VERSION HAD A REAL RACE AND IT WAS MINE.
    It read the tail, computed sequence and previous_hash from it, then
    appended -- three steps with no lock. The failure is documented precisely
    elsewhere: "two concurrent transactions can both execute the MAX query
    before either one has inserted. Neither blocks the other. Both read the
    same value. Both insert max + 1. THE CHAIN FORKS."

    A hash chain has a single-writer invariant: "concurrent appends are not
    safe on a plain hash chain." Two gate runs -- a local `mise run check` and
    a hook firing at the same moment -- are enough to fork it, and verify_chain
    would then report tampering that never happened. A false alarm from a
    tamper-evident log is worse than none, because it teaches people to ignore
    it.

    THE LOCK SPANS THE WHOLE READ-COMPUTE-WRITE, not just the write. Locking
    only the append would leave both writers holding the same stale tail.
