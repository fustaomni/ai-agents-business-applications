"""Correlation and timing metadata for a single contract run.

WHY PROPAGATE RATHER THAN INVENT
A trace id this process makes up correlates with nothing. The standard is to
read one a caller already established: OpenTelemetry specifies environment
variables as context carriers, and real systems do exactly this -- an agent SDK
"injects TRACEPARENT and TRACESTATE into the child process environment, and the
CLI reads them so its span becomes a child of your span".

So TRACEPARENT is read when present and reported as null when absent. Absent is
the honest answer for a run nobody traced.

WHY THERE IS A run_id ANYWAY
Correlation still has to work without a tracer. A run id groups the lines of one
invocation when several are aggregated, and costs nothing when nothing reads it.

WHY THERE IS NO HOSTNAME
The obvious field, and this machine's is "thanhphongle-MacBookPro" -- it
contains a person's name. This repository runs a PII scanner precisely to keep
identifying data out of committed artifacts, and emitting a hostname into a JSON
document destined for logs would plant PII deliberately.

If a fleet ever needs to distinguish machines, an opaque per-machine identifier
derived and stored locally is the shape to use -- not the name the person gave
their laptop.

WHY DURATION IS MEASURED
A `nix eval` that succeeds in thirty seconds is a signal -- a daemon under
strain, a cold cache -- that a boolean cannot carry. It is the difference
between "it worked" and "it worked, barely".

    WHY EVERY PROBE IS RECORDED, INCLUDING THE ONES THAT SUCCEEDED
    A contract that reports only conclusions cannot be audited. With this, a
    reader can see WHICH commands produced the verdict -- and a slow success
    ("`nix eval` took 30s") is a signal a boolean cannot carry.

    TRUNCATION IS EVIDENCE, NOT SILENCE
    `truncated` is recorded rather than left implicit, so a reader can tell a
    short error from a cut one. A production runner names this requirement
    exactly: "bounded stdout/stderr capture WITH TRUNCATION EVIDENCE".

    ARGV IS RECORDED, AND THAT IS SAFE HERE SPECIFICALLY
    Argument redaction matters wherever a command receives a secret. These are
    fixed `nix` invocations with store paths, run in an environment CONSTRUCTED
    rather than inherited -- nothing sensitive is passed in to echo back. That
    reasoning does not survive a command taking a credential as an argument, and
    redaction must come first if one is ever added.
