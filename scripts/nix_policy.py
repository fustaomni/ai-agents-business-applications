"""Evaluate the Nix contract policy, which lives in Rego.

WHY THE RULES ARE NOT IN PYTHON
verify() was a sequence of `if` statements appending to a list -- rules that
could not be enumerated or tested individually without running the whole
function. Rego describes "what is true under what conditions, not a sequence of
imperative steps", which is "significantly easier to audit, peer-review, and
test than procedural logic embedded inside application code".

It is this repository's convention too: policies/ already holds bundle, merge,
runtime and task rules, linted by regal and exercised by `opa test`. Having the
rules in BOTH places would be worse than either, because two implementations of
one policy drift and the drift is silent.

WHY A SUBPROCESS RATHER THAN AN EMBEDDED INTERPRETER
The embedded options were checked and each costs more than it saves:
regorus's Python bindings are "not yet available in PyPI"; opa-eval requires a
Rust toolchain and maturin; opa-golib-python-bindings requires Go >= 1.26 and
Python >= 3.14, while this project pins 3.12.3.

Subprocess overhead is documented at 50-200 ms per call. This runs ONCE per
contract invocation, and opa is already a pinned tool that evaluate_policies.py
already calls the same way. Adding a Rust or Go toolchain to reclaim 150 ms
once would be a poor trade.

WHY opa IS RESOLVED DIFFERENTLY FROM nix
nix probes run in a CONSTRUCTED environment, because the environment can change
what nix reports -- an inherited NIX_CONFIG could enable a feature and make a
probe certify a capability the project does not have.

opa evaluates a JSON document handed to it on stdin. No environment variable
changes that verdict. So opa is a project tool from the toolchain, like ruff,
rather than a subject of the trusted-directory allowlist that exists to stop a
substituted `nix`. The distinction looks like an inconsistency and is not: one
is the thing under investigation, the other is the instrument.

    and this repository has watched that shape go stale three times.

    Rego cannot enumerate its own rules: rego.metadata.rule() returns
    annotations for the ACTIVE rule only, and querying other rules' metadata is
    an open OPA request rather than a feature. So the enumeration happens from
    OUTSIDE, where `opa inspect -a` reads the annotations the rules carry.

    Moving the string into .manifest would have RELOCATED the problem, not fixed

    OPA's own guidance is that a revision must be STABLE: identifiers like
    uuid or time.now_ns "will cause your bundles to be replaced for every
    build", while hash sums give "the same result" when nothing changed. Both a
    commit SHA and a content hash satisfy that.

    A content hash wins here because the policy is evaluated from the WORKING
    TREE, which can be dirty. A commit SHA would name a commit whose content is
    not what actually ran -- reporting a version that was never evaluated, which
    is worse than no version.
