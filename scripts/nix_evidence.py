"""Record what crossed the system boundary, so a run can be replayed.

WHY THIS IS POSSIBLE AT ALL
scripts/nix_system.py defines a Protocol through which EVERY impure operation
passes -- subprocess, filesystem, users, groups. That is precisely the boundary
record-and-replay needs: "identify a boundary around state and computation,
record all sources of nondeterminism crossing into the boundary, and reexecute
by replaying them".

Because the boundary already exists, a recorder and a replayer are two more
implementations of it rather than a rewrite.

WHAT IS RECORDED
Both sides of every call. The guidance is explicit that "any subprocess
execution must be traced with both the request and response", because "recording
tool inputs and outputs eliminates the need to query the real system during
replay".

WHAT REPLAY IS FOR
  A verdict can be re-derived from the evidence that produced it. "Did this
  conclusion follow from these observations?" becomes answerable rather than
  assertable.

  A policy change can be tested against real recorded machines instead of
  invented ones -- the strongest use, since a fake reflects what its author
  imagined and a recording reflects a machine that existed.

  A broken installation can be diagnosed without access to it. The bundle
  travels; the laptop does not.

WHAT REPLAY IS NOT
It reproduces the OBSERVATION, not the machine. A bundle recorded before a
change and replayed after gives the old verdict, correctly -- it is evidence of
what was true then. Treating a replay as a current health check would be
exactly the stale-cache mistake the probes were just hardened against.
