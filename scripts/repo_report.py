"""Repository state, observed by a task as typed evidence (D.16).

NOT TEXT. git status --porcelain=v1 -z is the stable, machine-readable form:
NUL-separated records of a two-character status and a path, with a rename or
copy carrying its original path as a second record -- which a line-based reader
of the human output gets wrong. Each worktree's changes, its position against
origin/develop and the long-lived branches' positions become typed fields, and
every verdict is a boolean computed from them.

RECORDED. The task's outcome is appended to the run ledger, from day one.
