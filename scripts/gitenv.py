"""A git environment that cannot be redirected by an inherited GIT_DIR.

NAMED gitenv.py, FLAT, DELIBERATELY.
It was scripts/git/env.py first. A directory named `git` on sys.path shadows the
`git` module GitPython installs, and `env` is generic enough to collide with
anything -- the documented failure mode where a file named like a real module is
imported instead of it. Flat names in one directory cannot do that.

KNOWN DEBT, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: shared helper code belongs in an installed
src/ package, not in scripts/ reached through pythonpath. The 2026 guidance is
explicit -- prefer the src layout, deprecate PYTHONPATH hacks. This repo already
has that arrangement and already imports through it, so this file uses it rather
than enlarging the problem with a shadowing directory. The migration is a change
of its own, not something to half-do inside a branch about worktrees.

THE PROBLEM, IN GIT'S OWN WORDS
"Environment variables, such as GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE, etc., are exported so
that Git commands run by the hook can correctly locate the repository. If your
hook needs to invoke Git commands in a foreign repository or in a different
working tree of the same repository, then it should clear these environment
variables so they do not interfere with Git operations at the foreign location."

Those variables OVERRIDE `-C` and `cwd`. Any git call made from inside a hook
therefore operates on the hook's repository regardless of where it was pointed.

WHY THIS REPO IS EXPOSED
tests/test_no_data_in_repo.py runs `git ls-files` with cwd=ROOT, and it runs
under the pre-commit hook. Today the hook's repository and ROOT are the same, so
it works by coincidence. From a linked worktree they differ, and the check that
asserts no data is tracked would read a different index entirely -- passing while
inspecting the wrong repository.

Elsewhere the same inheritance produced a real incident: a test fixture's
`git commit` wrote into the actual repository and the stray commit was pushed.

WHY `git rev-parse --local-env-vars` RATHER THAN A HARDCODED LIST
It is git's own enumeration of the repository-routing variables, so it stays
correct when git adds one. A literal list is a second copy of something git
already owns, and it goes stale silently -- the same argument this repo makes
about ci.yml restating the gate list.
