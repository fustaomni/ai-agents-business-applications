# scripts/release.py
"""Perform a release: promote, export the executed run, verify it, and tag.

WHY THIS EXISTS
main advanced once with no release performed -- no export, no submission, no tag
-- because someone clicked GitHub's "Compare & pull request" banner. The ruleset
allowed it correctly: a PR and a green gate, both satisfied. Nothing in this repo
said WHEN main may advance, so that rule lived in commit prose and enforced
nothing.

WHY THE RUN IS EXPORTED, NOT THE NOTEBOOK
The Canvas deliverable is an EXECUTED notebook. The bundle deploys the notebook
as source; the outputs belong to the RUN. `workspace export` would produce the
file the job READ, not what it produced -- source with empty cells, which looks
like a valid submission and is not one.

WHY THE TAG MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS
Without one, "which commit was submitted for assignment 1" is answerable only by
reading merge dates. With one it is a name -- which also makes a regrade or a
late fix a hotfix off a known point rather than archaeology. The tag message
records the JOB RUN, which is what identifies the exported work.

EVERY REFUSAL RUNS BEFORE THE IRREVERSIBLE STEP
An earlier version promoted develop to main and THEN checked the working tree,
refusing after a merge to a protected branch had already happened.

ANY ASSIGNMENT, DERIVED FROM THE BUNDLE (D.14). The export directory, job name
and notebook name were fixed to Assignment 1. They are derived now from one job
key in the bundle resolved for the fixture target -- whose names carry no dev
prefix -- so a suffix match finds the job in dev and prod alike, and there is no
second mapping of assignments to jobs to drift. policies/release then refuses a
tag that does not name the assignment being released.
