TWO VIEWS, ONE DOCUMENT. plan-step/v1 carries the step as ProjectPlan validates it
-- what the step contains -- and its block exactly as written, with line numbers
-- what an edit must anchor on. Reading a step by hand twice, and an edit refused
on a formatting difference, is what made this a task.
