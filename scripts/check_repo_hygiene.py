"""Refuse tracked files that look like accidents.

WHY THIS EXISTS
A zero-byte file named `nix_contract` -- the debris of a mistyped shell
redirect -- sat at the repository root and was swept into a commit by
`git add -A`. No gate saw it: not the secret scan, not the PII scan, not
check:no-data-in-repo, not lint. It surfaced only because the commit output
listed it and someone read the list.

The same accident is common enough to be recognisable: one project records "a
Mach-O executable from a one-off test harness in the repo root was accidentally
swept into PR #54 by git add -A", another removed "7 stray files" from a
dogfooding run.

PROPERTIES, NOT AN ALLOWLIST
The obvious fix is a list of permitted root entries. This repository has
watched that shape go stale three times, so the check asks what makes a file
look accidental instead:

  EMPTY. A tracked zero-byte file carries nothing. The legitimate exceptions
  are marker files, which are named for the purpose.

  NO EXTENSION AND NO KNOWN NAME. Root-level files are either dotfiles,
  conventional extensionless names (LICENSE, Makefile), or they have a
  suffix. `nix_contract` was none of those -- it was a script name with the
  .py lost to a redirect.

Neither property needs maintaining when a real file is added, because a real
file has content and a name that fits one of those shapes.
