"""The observation and the verdict, as types both sides can depend on.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
nix_output needed NixInstallation and ContractReport for its signatures, and
nix_contract needed build_output for its envelope. That is a genuine cycle, and
it was "solved" with a TYPE_CHECKING guard -- which does not remove the cycle,
it hides it from the runtime.

The guidance on that is explicit: "do not move imports into if TYPE_CHECKING
solely to break circular imports... avoid any pattern whose sole purpose is to
hide imports from runtime while exposing them only to the type checker", and
"existing TYPE_CHECKING blocks: do not extend; prefer to remove."

The named fix is this: "when A and B both need the same thing and importing
from each other creates the circle, extract the shared code into a new module C
that neither A nor B imports back. Common extraction targets are constants,
base classes, TYPE DEFINITIONS."

So the models live here, in a leaf. nix_contract and nix_output both import it
and neither imports the other back for types. The graph is acyclic by
construction rather than by a guard someone must remember not to touch, and
runtime and type-checking behaviour no longer diverge.

WHAT IS HERE AND WHAT IS NOT
Types and the constants they validate against. The BEHAVIOUR -- observing a
machine, judging it, printing a report -- stays in nix_contract, because that
is what depends on this and not the reverse.
