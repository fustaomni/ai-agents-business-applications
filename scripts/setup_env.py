# scripts/setup_env.py
"""A worktree's setup never inherits another checkout's virtual environment (D.12).

uv is not run FROM an environment, it manages one: it locates the project's .venv
from the working directory, and an inherited VIRTUAL_ENV -- here, the main
checkout's -- only earns "does not match the project environment path" on every
worktree. 2026 practice is a clean environment, not a suppressed warning:
VIRTUAL_ENV and UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT are removed before uv runs.

THE PAIR. setup-environment/v1 records which of those variables setup would
inherit; machine.setup decides which have leaked and refuses any that remain.
The caller's own environment is never modified -- a new mapping is returned.
