"""The Databricks CLI as a boundary: every response validated by what is read from it.

ONE BOUNDARY, WHERE THERE WERE TWO. bootstrap_identity.py and check_prereqs.py
held byte-identical copies of a helper returning the CLI's JSON as Any, and
release.py parsed the same CLI's output raw. Untrusted input with no model, in
three places.

THE CLI OWNS THESE SCHEMAS, so each model declares only the fields this
repository reads and ignores the rest. The fields are the ones the scripts
already relied on, through two releases and a provisioned workspace.

AN UNEXPECTED SHAPE REFUSES, NAMING THE COMMAND. The old helpers turned an
unreadable answer into an empty result, so check:prereqs could report a catalog
missing when the truth was a response it could not read.
