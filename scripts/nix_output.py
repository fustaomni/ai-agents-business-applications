"""The output envelope, as a type rather than a hand-built dict.

WHY THIS EXISTS
main() assembled a dict literal, which meant the output shape existed nowhere as
a declaration. Three consequences, all of which happened:

  No schema could be exported, because there was no type to generate one from.
  The key set had to be maintained BY HAND in a test, and was updated three
  separate times as fields were added.
  A typo in a key name would have produced a silently wrong document -- valid
  JSON, wrong contract.

Declaring the envelope fixes all three at the source. extra="forbid" "rejects
any new/renamed/removed fields or wrong types", the test validates against the
model rather than a remembered list, and model_json_schema() exports the
contract for consumers.

THE TYPE_CHECKING GUARD IS GONE, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE POINT
This module imported nix_contract under `if TYPE_CHECKING` to get the types for
build_output without closing an import cycle. That does not remove a cycle, it
hides one -- and the guidance is explicit that hiding an import from the runtime
while exposing it to the type checker is the pattern to avoid, not adopt.

The models moved to nix_models, a leaf both sides import and neither imports
back. The dependency graph is now acyclic by construction rather than by a
comment asking the next reader not to tidy an import.

WHY THE SCHEMA IS COMMITTED RATHER THAN GENERATED ON DEMAND
Regenerating from the model under a different pydantic version can change the
output: "a pydantic point release could subtly change the output and drift would
return through the back door". The generated schema is committed, and a test
fails if the model no longer produces it -- so the bytes change deliberately.
