"""The impure boundary: subprocesses and filesystem probes, behind a Protocol.

WHY THIS EXISTS
scripts/nix_contract.py called subprocess.run and Path.is_dir directly inside
observe(), which made that function untestable without a real Nix installation.
The tests worked around it by constructing NixInstallation by hand -- so verify()
was covered and the COLLECTION was not: the subprocess invocations, the version
string actually returned, the flake probe.

The standard this violates is stated plainly elsewhere: "outside a composition
root, a package must not call an impure stdlib entry point -- the clock, the
global random source, the network, a subprocess -- directly."

A PROTOCOL, NOT AN ABC
Protocols are structural: an implementer satisfies one by having the methods,
with no inheritance. That is what a boundary wants -- a test fake should not
need to import and subclass anything. ABCs are for sharing implementation
between subclasses, which is not the situation here.

FAKES, NOT MOCKS
The test double lives in the test file and returns canned results. Mock
libraries let a test assert on HOW a function was called, which couples the test
to the implementation; a fake only has to behave.

THE ENVIRONMENT SANITIZATION LIVES HERE
It belongs with the subprocess call it protects, not in the module that happens
to need one. NIX_* is excluded by construction -- an inherited NIX_CONFIG can
enable flakes for a probe while the project's real shell has them off,
certifying a capability that does not exist.
