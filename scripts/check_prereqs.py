"""Verify the things the bundle depends on but cannot own.

WHY THESE ARE NOT BUNDLE RESOURCES
  the catalog        Catalogs ARE a bundle resource type, but a declared catalog
                     is always CREATED via POST /catalogs, and
                     `bundle deployment bind` cannot adopt UC catalogs
                     (databricks/cli#4842). This one already exists, so declaring
                     it guarantees a create-conflict with no way out.
  the reader group   Groups are not a bundle resource type at all. Provisioned by
                     scripts/bootstrap_groups.py; see that file for why it is not
                     Terraform on this tier.

WHY CHECK RATHER THAN ASSUME
An unmanaged dependency that nothing verifies is an assumption wearing a
comment. When one of these is missing, `bundle deploy` fails with an API error
that names the symptom, not the cause. This fails first and says what to run.

# NO PROFILE HANDLING HERE, DELIBERATELY.
#
# The CLI resolves credentials in a documented order -- SDK config, then
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, then the .databrickscfg DEFAULT profile -- stopping at
# the first success, and environment variables take precedence over the profile.
#
# That is exactly the branch this file used to implement in Python:
#   CI       has DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID and _SECRET -> found at step 2
#   a laptop has neither -> falls through to the DEFAULT profile
#
# Earlier versions passed "-p cscie103" and later branched on env vars to decide
# whether to. Both were code compensating for one original choice: authenticating
# into a NAMED profile instead of DEFAULT. Removing that removes the branch, the
# heuristic, and the whole class of "which environment am I in" bug.
