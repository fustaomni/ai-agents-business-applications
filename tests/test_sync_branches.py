# tests/test_sync_branches.py
"""Sync keeps every long-lived branch current, fast-forward only (D.10).

THE INVARIANT. A long-lived branch -- develop or main -- is never behind its
remote, never ahead of it, never diverged from it. Behind is repaired by a
fast-forward; ahead and diverged need a person, so they are reported and never
forced. machine.branches decides; sync remediates and then asks it.

WHY main SAT ELEVEN RELEASES BEHIND. sync pulled the branch it was on and nothing
else. git fetch origin main:main updates a branch without checking it out, and
git itself refuses a non-fast-forward there -- so a divergence surfaces as an
error instead of being clobbered. It also refuses a branch checked out in a
worktree, so that case is fast-forwarded inside its own worktree.
