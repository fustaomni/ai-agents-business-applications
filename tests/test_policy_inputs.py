"""Every policy input is validated by a contract at the boundary (C.15).

THE INPUTS THAT PREDATED THE CONTRACTS. The task commands were read from
mise.toml as a raw dict and handed on as dicts; the resolved bundle was CLI
output parsed with json.loads and merged straight into the payload; the Nix
policy input was a dict assembled by hand; and the Nix policy's answer was read
by indexing raw JSON. Each now enters through a model.

OPEN WHERE THE VENDOR IS OPEN. The bundle model declares what policies read and
keeps everything else, because the CLI owns that schema and the policies read
more of it than any one script does.
