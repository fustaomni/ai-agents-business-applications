# tests/test_commit.py
"""Committing is a project operation, and it was never captured.

WHAT THIS FIXES. Every commit in this repository has been made by hand as
`git commit --file /tmp/commit-msg.txt --no-verify`. Two defects in one habit:

    NOT A TASK      mise.toml states that every project operation is a task,
                    "not a remembered command, not a paste from scrollback".
                    The single most frequent operation here was the exception.

    --no-verify     the pre-commit hooks -- start:check, fmt, lint -- have been
                    skipped on EVERY commit. The gate was only ever reached at
                    push time, so a protected-branch commit or an unformatted
                    file was caught late or not at all.

NAMED PATHS, NEVER -A. `git add -A` swept a stray zero-byte file into a commit
earlier in this project; the hygiene gate exists because of it. Naming the paths
makes what is committed a decision rather than whatever the tree happened to
hold.

THE OUTCOME IS AN ENVELOPE. This is the first consumer of command-outcome/v1:
a refusal carries a machine code and exits 2, a failure exits 1, and a caller
branches without reading prose.
