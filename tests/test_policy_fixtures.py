"""Assert the bundle policy reads shapes the real system actually produces.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS PYTHON RATHER THAN REGO
The Rego unit tests use input fixtures written by hand. That tests rule LOGIC,
which is necessary and not sufficient: a rule can be logically perfect and read a
path that does not exist, in which case it iterates nothing and denies nothing.

That happened here. A rule read input.bundle.targets[_].workspace.host -- the
structure of databricks.yml as WRITTEN -- while `bundle validate --output json`
reports the bundle as RESOLVED, with targets already collapsed into a flat
workspace block. The rule could never fire. It passed every test, because the
tests used fixtures invented from the same wrong assumption. Two errors in the
same direction cancel out and look like correctness.

The industry name for the failure is fixture drift, and the consequence is worse
than no gate: a check that passes what the real system would reject erodes trust
faster than having no check at all.

So these assertions run against tests/fixtures/bundle-resolved-fixture-target.json, captured
from the actual command. `mise run fixtures:update` regenerates it, and
check:fixtures fails the build when the captured shape no longer matches what the
CLI produces.

    THIS IS THE CHECK WHOSE ABSENCE COST THREE CI RUNS.
    The fixture captured `dev` at first, whose resolved output embeds the

    from paths, resource names, tags and the name prefix -- everything a target
    controls -- so I concluded the scrubbers were dead and deleted them.

    They were not. workspace.current_user is populated from the CREDENTIALS in
    use, which no target setting changes, and CI failed on the next push. The
    assumption was testable; I tested it only afterwards, by hand.

    MARKED integration BECAUSE IT SHELLS OUT TO THE CLI. It needs network and
    Databricks auth, and `test` runs in check:offline behind the pre-push hook.
    A test requiring credentials there would break the offline guarantee, and a
    hook that fails on a plane is a hook people bypass.

    The substituted identity is synthetic -- a zero UUID, `some_sp` -- rather
    than the real service principal's, so this does not hardcode the identity it
