# tests/test_plan_amend.py
"""A plan entry is amended by a task that preserves the files' formatting (D.24).

Six amendments this session -- evidence and dependencies of existing steps -- were
hand-made text edits, one refused on a formatting difference. tomlkit replaces the
named fields of one step in place; every comment, and every other step, survives.

FIXTURE FILES, COPIED: each test works on a copy of the committed fixture plan (D.53).
