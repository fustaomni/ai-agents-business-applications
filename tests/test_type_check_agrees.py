"""The types task and the gate check the same files, declared once (C.16).

WHY IT DRIFTED. The file set was written twice -- `scripts` in mise.toml,
`scripts tests` in check_all.py -- so the task reported success over errors the
gate refused.

WHY CONFIGURATION ALONE IS NOT THE FIX. mypy checks its configured `files` only
when no path is given on the command line; a path given there overrides them.
Declared once and bypassed silently, `files` would look like a control while
governing nothing. So the policy refuses any invocation that names a path.
