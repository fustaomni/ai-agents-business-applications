# tests/test_commit_execution.py
"""Running the commit, with git injected so the test commits nothing.

WHY A SEPARATE FILE FROM test_commit.py. Planning is a pure decision and needs
no repository; executing runs a process and must not mutate one. Keeping them
apart means the planner's tests stay fast and total, and these tests assert on
the argv that WOULD have run rather than on a commit that did.

THE BOUNDARY IS INJECTED, exactly as nix_contract.py injects System. A fake
records what was asked of it, so the argv is observable without git being
involved at all.

THE ONE ASSERTION THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. --no-verify must never appear. Every
commit in this repository carried it, which skipped start:check, fmt and lint on
every single commit. A test that watches for its return is the only thing that
stops the habit coming back.
