# tests/test_plan_init.py
"""A generated project starts its own plan by task (D.53).

The template carries no plan: a project generated from it would otherwise inherit this
repository's history as its own. plan:init writes a day-one plan, its trace and its id
ledger, validated together through the three contracts before any is written, and
refuses when a plan already exists rather than overwrite one.
