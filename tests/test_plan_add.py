# tests/test_plan_add.py
"""Plan entries are added by a task that preserves the files' formatting (D.23).

tomlkit, the 2026 style-preserving TOML editor, appends the step to plan.toml's
[[steps]], its id to plan-ids.toml's issued and its trace entry to plan-trace.toml's
candidates -- and every comment survives. The three are validated by their
contracts together, before any is written: a refusal writes nothing.

FIXTURE FILES, COPIED: each test works on a copy of the committed fixture plan (D.53).
