"""Lock the JSON output contract.

WHY A SCHEMA VERSION NEEDS A TEST TO MEAN ANYTHING
A version field nobody checks is decoration: the shape drifts, the number stays
at 1.0, and a consumer that pinned to it is misled rather than protected.

The 2026 convention pairs the two deliberately -- one project describes golden
tests that "fail until regenerated, forcing the bump to be intentional", another
a CI test asserting "the documented top-level keys, locking the contracts".

WHAT THIS ASSERTS
The EXACT top-level key set of both envelopes. Adding a key, removing one, or
renaming one fails here -- and the fix is either to undo it or to bump
OUTPUT_SCHEMA_VERSION deliberately. That is the whole mechanism.

It does not assert values. Those change with the machine; the shape must not.
