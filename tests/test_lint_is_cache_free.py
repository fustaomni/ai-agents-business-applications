"""The local gate lints as CI does: every ruff check runs cache-free (C.17).

WHY. ruff decides whether an import is first-party by whether the module exists
on disk, and its cache does not key on that. A module created after the file
importing it was linted left a stale classification the laptop kept passing,
while CI -- which has no cache -- refused the same file with I001.

ruff format IS EXEMPT: formatting does not depend on which modules exist.
