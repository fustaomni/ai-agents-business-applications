"""Tests for the merge protocol.

WHY THESE EXIST
The protocol was verified by running the task once and watching it work. That is
the "worked when I tried it" standard this repo rejects everywhere else, and it
covers only the path the run happened to take -- not the refusals, which are the
part that matters.

Every refusal below is asserted FIRING. A guard seen only passing is
indistinguishable from one that cannot fire, and this project has shipped
exactly that: a Rego rule using a negative lookahead RE2 does not support, which
matched nothing while 21 tests passed.
