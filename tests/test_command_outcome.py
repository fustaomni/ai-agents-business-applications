# tests/test_command_outcome.py
"""The envelope every command writes to stdout, asserted before it exists.

WHY THIS FILE COMES FIRST. The contract is the deliverable; the model is an
implementation of it. Written the other way round, a test proves only that the
author can describe what they already wrote.

WHAT IS BEING FIXED. Every command in this repository prints prose, so a caller
reads it with grep -- presentation filtering, not evidence. check_all.py prints
PASS and FAIL; nix_contract.py prints JSON but of its own shape; pr.py prints
sentences. Nothing a machine consumes is a declared contract.

THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO, AND THAT IS THE POINT. A refusal is not a failure: the
command worked and denied what was asked. This repository already draws that
line inside the Nix contract -- POLICY_DENIED is not an error -- and then loses
it at the process boundary, where exit 1 means both "the policy said no" and
"the command broke". A caller cannot tell them apart.
