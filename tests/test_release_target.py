# tests/test_release_target.py
"""A release is derived from its job in the bundle, and its tag names it (D.14).

HARD-WIRED TO ASSIGNMENT 1. release.py fixed its export directory, job name
suffix and notebook name, so no other assignment could be released. Each is now
derived from one job key in the RESOLVED bundle -- the job's name, and from its
notebook_path the assignment directory and the notebook -- so there is no second
mapping to drift.

THE FIXTURE IS THE CLI'S REAL SHAPE, captured from bundle validate and reduced to one
job with a neutral identity, not an imitation written for the test. It is these
tests' own, so every project generated from this template keeps them true (D.64).

A TAG NAMES ITS ASSIGNMENT. assignment-02-v1 on Assignment 1's run would point a
regrade at the wrong work; policies/release refuses it before anything merges.
