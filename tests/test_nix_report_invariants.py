"""The findings and the verdicts must agree, enforced by the model.

WHY THE INVARIANT IS IN THE MODEL, NOT HERE
A test checks a relationship where it happens to look. A validator checks it
everywhere a report is constructed -- in replay, in the fake-driven tests, and
in any caller written later.

WHY EXHAUSTIVE RATHER THAN PROPERTY-BASED
Hypothesis is the right tool when an input space is too large to enumerate, and
the framing that motivates it is exact: "example-based unit tests catch a
specific bug; mechanical invariants catch the class of bug."

This space is small enough to enumerate COMPLETELY -- which codes fired, crossed
with what verdict each carries. Exhaustive enumeration is strictly stronger than
random sampling over the same space, and it adds no dependency. Sampling would
be a weaker check bought at a higher price.

The example tests below remain, because a named case documents WHY a
combination is illegal in a way a generated counterexample does not.
