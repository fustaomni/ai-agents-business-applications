"""The committed plan, trace and id ledger validate and agree.

A MATRIX NOBODY VERIFIES IS AN ARCHIVE: it looks complete because nothing
contradicts it. These name every way the three files can disagree.

AND THE HISTORY IS QUOTED, NEVER AUTHORED. A step backfilled from work already
done cites the commits that built it, and each citation must be a commit that
exists, quoted by its own subject verbatim. Reconstructing history means
grouping what it says, not writing what it should have said.
