"""Enforce which observations policy is allowed to read.

WHY THIS EXISTS
NixInstallation holds two kinds of field and nothing distinguished them: facts
that DECIDE the verdict and facts merely RECORDED. is_determinate is the
dangerous one -- it notes that this machine runs a vendor fork, and a later
reader could start enforcing it, quietly making the fork mandatory.

A comment saying "informational" would be the kind of aspirational document
that "lived in wikis and slide decks" and was never enforced. This parses
verify() and checks what it actually touches, so the declaration is binding.

WHY AST INSPECTION RATHER THAN A CONVENTION
A convention is followed until someone is in a hurry. Reading the source means
the rule holds regardless of intent: adding `if installation.is_determinate` to
verify() fails here, and the fix is either to remove it or to move the field
into POLICY_INPUTS on purpose -- which is a decision someone makes rather than
one that happens.
