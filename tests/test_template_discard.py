# tests/test_template_discard.py
"""An unpublished generated project holding only its generated commit can be discarded (D.63).

Removal is the one irreversible operation in a project's bootstrap, so every refusal is
proven through observe() and the policy alone: no test ever calls main() on anything but
a scratch project in tmp_path, so a rule that is wrong while RED cannot delete anything.
