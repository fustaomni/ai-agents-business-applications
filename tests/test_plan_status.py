"""Status is decided by policy over facts observed on the integration branch (G.3).

THE PAIR. The observer records what holds on origin/develop as plan-facts/v1;
policies/plan decides each step's state; plan-status/v1 validates the decision
coming back from OPA. These tests only prove the policy decides.

UNOBSERVABLE IS NOT DONE. Evidence of a kind this observation could not see --
a merged pull request with GitHub unreachable -- leaves a step unknown, never
done and never failed.

A PROOF HOLDS ONLY WHEN THE TEST EXISTS. The source this is ported from checked
that the test FILE was in the tree, though its comment promised the named
function; a renamed test read as proof. Here the function must be defined.
