# tests/test_merge_readiness.py
"""A pull request merges on GitHub's own verdict, decided by policy (D.19).

WHAT BROKE. Release's promotion PR had a finished check on its head commit --
develop's own push run -- so every VISIBLE check was green while the PR's required
run had not registered. The merge was attempted and refused: GitHub's
mergeStateStatus said BLOCKED, which it reports while required checks are queued.

THE PAIR. MergeState admits exactly GitHub's eight values; merge.readiness decides
wait, merge or refuse from the state and every check; the wait loop returns only
on a decision. These tests prove it bites.
