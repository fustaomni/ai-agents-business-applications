"""Tests for the repository state model.

WHY THIS IS TESTED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
The model exists because cleanup with no model of what it was cleaning aborted
mid-sync. A replacement whose decision logic is unverified would be the same
failure with more structure.

Every case constructs Branch and Worktree directly rather than manipulating a
repository -- the fields are the state, so the decision table is reachable in
process without creating branches on disk.
