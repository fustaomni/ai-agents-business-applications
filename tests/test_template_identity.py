# tests/test_template_identity.py
"""A generated project takes its identity from the source, before it has a remote (D.59).

start:here needs origin, origin needs the repository named rightly, the name needs
identity:set, and committing that needs a feature branch. The cycle closes only if a
fresh project takes its identity as its second commit, from the source, while it
has no remote. policies/runs/template/identity decides when; these prove each rule bites.
