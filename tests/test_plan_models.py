"""The plan, its trace and its id ledger, as contracts (ported from otsafety-gnn).

WHY THE PLAN IS A FILE. This repository's history -- sixty-six commits across
toolchain, platform, gates, workflow and coursework -- was organised only in
conversations. A plan held in a conversation is lost with it, and is wrong
whenever memory is.

STATUS IS NEVER WRITTEN. A step declares the evidence that proves it done, and
status is observed from that evidence. A hand-written status is refused outright.

RAW INPUT IS JsonValue, NOT Any. These helpers deliberately build invalid
shapes to prove the contract refuses them, so they cannot be typed as the
models; JsonValue names exactly "untyped JSON, to be validated", and keeps
everything else checked.
