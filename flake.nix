  # THE TOOLCHAIN THIS PROJECT NEEDS, DECLARED.
  #
  # Nix was installed by `curl | sh` and captured by scripts/nix_contract.py.
  # This is what that installation is FOR: the nine tools mise pins, resolved
  # from a locked nixpkgs and reproducible on any supported platform.
  #
  # TWO NAMES DIFFER FROM THE mise REGISTRY, both found by searching nixpkgs
  # rather than assuming:
  #   opa  -> open-policy-agent  (the binary is still `opa`)
  #   java -> temurin-bin-17     (NOT jdk17. mise defaults to OpenJDK and the
  #                               vendor prefix is mandatory there for the same
  #                               reason: a different build is a different tool)

    # UNSTABLE, WHICH IS THE RIGHT BRANCH FOR A DEV TOOLCHAIN.
    #
    # This was pinned to nixos-26.05 on the reasoning that "a gate must not
    # change because upstream moved". That reasoning was wrong twice over.
    #
    # A release branch is FROZEN at release and receives only security
    # backports, so by September its packages are four months stale by design:
    # uv 0.11.21 against the 0.12.5 this project then pinned, regal 0.40 against 0.42,
    # zizmor 1.25 against 1.29. Choosing it bought staleness, not safety.
    #
    # And the safety it was chosen for comes from flake.lock, not the branch:
    # the lock "records the exact Git commit hash... all ambiguity is gone".
    # The branch only decides where `nix flake update` moves TO. Nothing here
    # changes until someone updates the lock deliberately. That deliberate update
    # is `mise run run nix:lock-update` (D.86): judged by the CI flake checker's
    # own 30-day condition, and the old lock restored if anything is refused.
    #
    # The guidance splits exactly on this: unstable "is fine for dev machines.
    # For production or CI, pin to a release branch". This is a toolchain of
    # linters, formatters and CLIs -- a dev machine's toolbox, not a system
    # whose uptime depends on conservative packages.

      # x86_64-darwin IS GONE, AND THE SHELF LIFE RAN OUT DURING THIS CHANGE.
      #
      # 26.05 warned it "will be the last release to support x86_64-darwin",
      # following Apple's announcement that macOS 26 is the final version for
      # Intel Macs. Switching to unstable -- now 26.11-dev -- crossed that line:
      # evaluation fails outright with "Nixpkgs 26.11 has dropped support for
      # x86_64-darwin", not a warning.
      #
      # THE COMMENT PREDICTING THIS WAS WRITTEN AN HOUR BEFORE IT HAPPENED, and
      # said the double "leaves both this list and the policy together". This is
      # that: three systems here, and the policy's supported set narrowed to
      # match in the same change.

      # NOT a nixpkgs-26.05-darwin input to keep it alive. That would pin one
