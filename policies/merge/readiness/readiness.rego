# Every visible check being green is not a verdict: a finished check already on the
# head commit answered while the PR's required run had not registered. GitHub
# reports BLOCKED while required checks are queued or running, and UNKNOWN while it
# is still computing, so those states wait. Every rule needs a pull_request input,
# so the gate's own payload leaves this package quiet.
